# Titanic Survival Predictor
This project is based on a dynamic Decision Tree model that is used to analyze and predict whether a person, who had boarded the Titanic has a chance of survival or not, using machine learning.

### Description
Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms.The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).

### Technology Used
* Decision Tree
* Supervised Learning
* Feature Engineering
* sklearn
* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib
