# Titanic-Survival-Predictor
This project is based on a Logistic Regression model that is used to analyze and predict whether a person, who had boarded the Titanic has a chance of survival or not, using machine learning.

### Description
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.

### Technology Used
* Logistic Regression
* Supervised Learning
* Feature Engineering
* sklearn
* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib
